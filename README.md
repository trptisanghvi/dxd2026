### Art description & images
_Turnstile Murmurations_ transforms a familiar piece of urban infrastructure into a responsive light sculpture that registers collective movement rather than enforcing passage. An ode to New York City artists and the MTA subway, the work references Marcel Duchamp’s readymade tradition—pioneered in his 20th-century New York studio. By reclaiming the turnstile, the piece strips the object of utility to expose its sculptural form as a metaphor for an Information Ecosystem.

Industrial LEDs, echoing Dan Flavin’s use of standardized light found in the city’s hardware stores, replace mechanical rotation with illumination. The work enters into dialogue with the NYC Minimalist lineage, where the materials of the street become the medium of the gallery. Instead of bodies physically passing through a barrier, time-based ridership data from the 1/2/3, 4/5/6, and N/Q/R lines activate sequences of accumulation and decay. These pulses swell and recede to measure the circadian rhythm of the city that never sleeps — mirroring our collective cycles of congestion and calm.

Following Sol LeWitt’s rule-based approach, the artwork is governed by instructions executed by a microcontroller. The artist designs the system, but the city performs it; the composition emerges from collective behavior over time.
By translating invisible urban rhythms into spatial experience, Turnstile Murmurations reframes infrastructure as a form of choreography — one that quietly shapes how bodies move, wait, and belong. The sculpture does not merely represent the city from a distance; it listens to it, allowing light to register the public's living tempo as a luminous murmuration.
